Fetch bandwidth usage data from TP-LINK Archer C9 router

## About
This script will fetch bandwidth statistics from the web interface of the TP-LINK Archer C9 router. In order for statistics to be collected by the router, NAT hardware acceleration (i.e. the "NAT Boost" setting) needs to be turned off. I have written this script in order to compare my internally-gathered bandwidth usage statistics against measurements provided by my ISP.
